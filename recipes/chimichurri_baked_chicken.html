    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>1/2 Cup finely Chopped parsley</li>
      <li>2 1/2 table spoons olive</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon</li>
      <li>1/8 cup teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1(3 pound) whole chicken</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon oliveoil</li>
      <li>1 large onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Direction</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine parsley, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, oregano, vinegar, garlic,
        salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a bowl; mix the chimichurri
        thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on a cutting board and remove the backbone using kitchen
        shears. Press down on the breast with the heel of your hand to flatten.
        Loosen the skin of the chicken carefully and rub the chimichurri
        underneath, distributing it evenly. Wrap the chicken in plastic wrap and
        refrigerate for 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow chicken to come to room temperature for no more than 1 hour before
        baking.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil over the chicken; season with salt and pepper.
        Place onion in a cast-iron skillet. Pour chicken broth over onion. Place
        seasoned chicken on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the
        juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow chicken to rest in a warm area for 10
        minutes before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooks Note</h4>
    <p>
      If desired, you can drain the oil and puree what's left in the skillet
      using a stick blender to make a gravy.
