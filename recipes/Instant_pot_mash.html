    <p>
      A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes, for the
      Instant Pot®. The leeks add a very mild oniony flavor. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 Pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 leek, white parts only, quarted lengthwise and finely sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
      <li>water to cover</li>
      <li>1/3 cup milk, warmed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker
        (such as Instant Pot®). Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock
        the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions;
        set timer for 10 minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release
        remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes.
        Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the
        pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle,
        about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes
        with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a
        ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt.
